# usa-inbound_border_crossing

An analysis of data published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics on the number, type, and location of border crossings into the USA.  Data is reported monthly since 1997.  Here are supporting [details](https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Border-Crossing-Entry-Data/keg4-3bc2/about_data) and [data dictionary](https://bit.ly/4aBKJg0) for the dataset.  

This is an **explanatory** style analysis done in R. A [PDF document with the analyis](https://github.com/marc4data/usa-inbound_border_crossing/blob/main/_output/_main_analysis-v00.pdf) is in the [/_output](https://github.com/marc4data/usa-inbound_border_crossing/tree/main/_output) folder.  A complementary **exploratory** dashboard is published on my Tableau Public profile [here](https://bit.ly/4ch0NW2).  I prefer the flexibility and interactivity of the Tableau dashboard, but also built out the R product to demonstrate my ability to also produce analysis, graphics, and write-up with R.
